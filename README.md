# E-Commerce Back End

## Purpose:
- I wanted to demonstrate my skills with backend web development.

## Instructions for Use:
- You must have Insomnia, or some sort of API tester.
- `npm i` in order to download the proper dependencies.
- Make sure the database is set up using MySQL.
- Set up a localhost session on your machine using node or nodemon.
- Seed the data from the seeder file by doing `node seeds/`.
- In Insomnia, make the proper routes you would like to test.

## Starter-Code:
- I was given the code for the circle, which is located in the Develop folder.
